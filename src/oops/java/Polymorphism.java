/*
 * üîÑ Dynamic Method Dispatch (Runtime Polymorphism)
 *
 * - When a superclass reference variable refers to a subclass object,
 *   and an overridden method is called using that reference,
 *   the version in the subclass is executed.
 *
 * - The method to be executed is determined at runtime, not compile time.
 *
 * - This allows Java to support runtime polymorphism.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Only overridden instance methods participate in dynamic dispatch.
 * ‚ùå Static methods, instance variables, and constructors do not.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Animal a = new Dog();
 *   a.sound(); // Calls Dog's implementation of sound()
 *
 * This helps in writing flexible and extensible code (e.g., using interfaces or abstract classes).
